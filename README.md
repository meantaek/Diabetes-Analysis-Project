# Diabetes-Analysis-Project
The goal for this project was to create a model to accurately predict C-Peptide levels in patients that would indicate risk for diabetes.
The models used were the general additive model and the kernel regression model. In order to refine these models, I used 10-fold cross validation and resampling.
